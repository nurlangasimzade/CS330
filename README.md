This project has been both a technical challenge and a rewarding learning experience. Through the process of building a complete 3D scene, I developed a deeper understanding of the design and development cycle of software, especially in the context of computational graphics.

When it comes to designing software, I’ve learned that the most effective approach begins with clear visualization—imagining the final product and identifying the user or system goals it should meet. For this project, I mapped out the objects, interactions, and layout early on, which helped guide my technical decisions. The design process I followed was iterative: sketching initial ideas, implementing them in code, testing, and refining based on visual results and user interaction. This approach has helped me cultivate important design skills, such as spatial reasoning, scene composition, and camera interaction planning.

Working on this project sharpened my ability to design with intention. I learned how to apply design tactics like modular structuring of rendering logic, using abstraction for camera and lighting controls, and considering performance as part of design quality. These tactics will be useful in future work, especially in any project that requires visual or interactive components.

In developing the program, I adopted a step-by-step approach, breaking the scene into manageable components and writing modular code. I used version control to iterate through different features, such as lighting effects, object scaling, texture mapping, and camera navigation. Iteration played a key role—I often had to revise object positioning or tweak lighting angles to better serve the scene’s realism and readability. Over the course of the milestones, my coding strategy evolved from rigid implementation to more experimental and dynamic development, allowing for faster adjustments and higher code reusability.

This project reinforced for me how computer science can act as a powerful enabler toward my career goals. Understanding how to build visual, interactive programs adds another layer to my programming toolkit. Computational graphics and visualization have opened the door to new possibilities in fields such as virtual reality, game design, architectural modeling, and data visualization. These skills not only expand my career potential but also align closely with my future academic goals, including pursuing graduate studies in AI and advanced computer graphics.

In short, this project wasn't just about finishing a 3D scene—it was about learning how to see code as a creative tool for visual expression and technical precision. I walk away from this experience more confident in my ability to design and develop complex, graphics-based software systems.
